Erlang in two hours: a hands-on workshop
===============

Resources for the hands-on Erlang workshop presented at Codestock 2013 in Knoxville, TN, USA.


Abstract:
---------
Bring a laptop [*] because in this two hour lab/workshop you're going to learn how to write Erlang.

Erlang is an open source, functional programming language that is battletested. Amazon's SimpleDB, Facebook's chat, Opscode Chef, GitHub's pages, CouchDB, RabbitMQ and Basho's Riak are all written in Erlang.

Why? Because Erlang simplifies writing reliable, concurrent, distributed systems.

In this session you will learn the foundations of Erlang, set up a dev environment, build "Hello World", and move on to concurrent and distributed greatness. You will also learn how to run unit tests, debug, and profile code.

You won't leave the session an Erlang expert, but you'll have a great head start.

[*] I will be running on Windows, but you'll be fine with Mac or Linux.


Steps
-----

* **hello** :  A simple milestone  to make sure you have an environment set up to build and run Erlang.

* **fizzbuzz** : Shows pattern-matching, three ways to solve fizzbuzz, and unit testing

* **average** : Shows pattern-matching, tail call recursion, and various bits of syntax. Also used to demonstrate the debugger.

* **ssslow** : Demo to show off 'eprof' the built-in performance profiler.

* **hotload** : Demo to show off hotcode loading

* **manyproc** : Demo of lightweight Erlang processes

* **game** : Fun little server loop to show maintaining state and interaction between processes through message passing.
