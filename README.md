Erlang in two hours: a hands-on
===============

Resources for the hands-on Erlang workshop presented at Codestock 2013 in Knoxville, TN, USA.

Abstract:
---------
Bring a laptop [*] because in this two hour lab/workshop you're going to learn how to write Erlang.

Erlang is an open source, functional programming language that is battletested. Amazon's SimpleDB, Facebook's chat, Opscode Chef, GitHub's pages, CouchDB, RabbitMQ and Basho's Riak are all written in Erlang.

Why? Because Erlang simplifies writing reliable, concurrent, distributed systems.

In this session you will learn the foundations of Erlang, set up a dev environment, build "Hello World", and move on to concurrent and distributed greatness. You will also learn how to run unit tests, debug, and profile code.

You won't leave the session an Erlang expert, but you'll have a great head start.

[*] I will be running on Windows, but you'll be fine with Mac or Linux.
